However, the precise cause of the X-line motion remains unclear. Here we present data from five THEMIS probes positioned along the Sun-Earth line and show that a tailward retreat motion of the X-line (detected by the outermost probe P1) occurred when the dipolarized inner magnetosphere started to return to a more stretched, tail-like configuration (observed by the inner probes P3, P4, and P5). At an intermediate location (P2), the total pressure was increasing. These observations are consistent with the idea that the pressure increase in the inner magnetosphere eventually causes the X-line to retreat tailward.},

abstract = {Molecular ions play an important role in the balance of charged particles below the peak density in the F2 region. Balance is determined by ionization of the main neutral constituents by extreme UV solar radiation (EUVSR) and by dissociative recombination of the molecular ions. Using the empirical EUVSR model and the neutral densities given by the MSISE-90 (Mass Spectrometer-Incoherent Scatter) model, ionization rates can be calculated using well-developed, textbook-level analysis and then compared with the recombination rates corresponding to the molecular ion and electron densities given by the IRI-2001 and IRI-2007 empirical models. Our results show that the recombination rates calculated using the IRI model are larger by a factor of 5 to 30 than the ionization rates corresponding to the EUVSR empirical model at altitudes above 190 km at middle and low latitudes and low solar activity. Previously, and for similar reasons, we showed that the IRI predicted 630 nm and 557.7 nm emissions, which were found to be much higher than the observations (Vlasov et al., 2005; Nicolls et al., 2006). The discrepancy greatly increases from noon to dusk and decreases with increasing solar activity. Our results thus show a contradiction between the EUVSR model and the IRI model. Since empirical data on molecular ions are scarce, we argue that straightforward ion chemistry calculations should be added to the IRI to correct the discrepancy.},

abstract = {The results of a climatological study of ionospheric disturbances derived from observations of cosmic sources from the Very Large Array (VLA) Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS) are presented. We have used the ionospheric corrections applied to the 74 MHz interferometric data within the VLSS imaging process to obtain fluctuation spectra for the total electron content (TEC) gradient on spatial scales from a few to hundreds of kilometers and temporal scales from less than one minute to nearly an hour. The observations sample nearly all times of day and all seasons. They also span latitudes and longitudes from 28°N to 40°N and 95°W to 114°W, respectively. We have binned and averaged the fluctuation spectra according to time of day, season, and geomagnetic (Kp index) and solar (F10.7) activity. These spectra provide a detailed, multiscale account of seasonal and intraday variations in ionospheric activity with wavelike structures detected at wavelengths between about 35 and 250 km. In some cases, trends between spectral power and Kp index and/or F10.7 are also apparent. In addition, the VLSS observations allow for measurements of the turbulent power spectrum down to periods of 40 s (scales of ∼0.4 km at the height of the E-region). While the level of turbulent activity does not appear to have a strong dependence on eitherKp index or F10.7, it does appear to be more pronounced during the winter daytime, summer nighttime, and near dusk during the spring.},

ABSTRACT = {Possible ionospheric effects of the Morelian meteoroid that passed and exploded over Mexico on 19 February 2020 (18 February 2020 local time) were estimated. The meteoroid trajectory, velocity and time of occurrence were calculated based on outdoor camera records. Modeling was used to estimate the meteoroid initial diameter, density, mass, velocity, energy and their change during its flight in the atmosphere. The ensemble of ionospheric scintillation indices calculated from the high-rate GNSS data and the filtered slant Total Electron Content data were used to reveal the presence of ionospheric disturbances generated by shock waves excited by the meteoroid flight and explosion. The first ionospheric responses to phenomena accompanying the meteoroid were detected (2.5–3.5) min after the explosion. The disturbances were attenuated quickly with distance from their source and were rarely recorded by GNSS receivers located more than 600 km from the meteoroid explosion site. The ionospheric disturbances of intermediate-scale, small-scale, shock-acoustic-wave-scale and sometimes medium-scale were revealed. The detected disturbances corresponded to the range of acoustic-gravity waves. An asymmetry of the disturbance manifestation in different directions was observed. The obtained results are in accordance with results of the observation of other meteoroids. Although the object was smaller and of less energy than other known meteoroids, it is an interesting case because, to the best of our knowledge, it isthe first known to us low-latitude meteoroid with the detected ionospheric effects.},

abstract = {Abstract Bolides are detected by the Geostationary Lightning Mapper onboard the GOES-16 weather satellite, which takes images of Earth at a rate of 500 Hz in a 1.1 nm wide pass band centered on 777.4 nm wavelength. Ten case studies are discussed. These initial results were obtained using the Level 0 data received during the nonoperational in-orbit postlaunch test period. GLM positions and timings are sufficiently accurate to assist in trajectory and orbit reconstruction. GLM samples the light curve nearly completely, unaffected by onboard and downlink processes tailored to lightning data. Sufficient data on the instantaneous background scene are provided to reconstruct the baseline drift in the brightest pixels. The agreement to within a factor of 2–3 between measured total radiated energy from GLM and that derived from other space-borne observations implies that during the bolide's peak brightness the GLM pass band is dominated by continuum emission, rather than O I line emission. The reported flux is corrected for angle-from-nadir shifts in the central wavelength of the pass band, which overestimates continuum flux by only up to 20\% for most of the GLM field of view, but more so if the bolide is observed far from nadir. Assuming a 6000 K blackbody spectrum, GLM is able to detect bolides with peak visual magnitude (at a normalized 100 km distance) brighter than about −14 in nighttime, and slightly brighter in daytime.},
