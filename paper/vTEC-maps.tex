Ionospheric perturbations also can take place due to space weather and geomagnetic storms. So, in order to discard such events we investigated the space weather in the day each event occured. In figure (name) we present the geomagnetic \textit{Kp} index for some events. We discarded events whose Kp index is equal or grater than 4 in the day of the event or shortly before. Also we present in figure (name) the vTEC perturbation maps for the same events in a three day series, centered in the event date. The estimated meteor trajectory, obtained from the GLM data is presented in black, continous line, while the linear fit to the GOES-16 and GOES-17 data are presented with the red dashed line, and work as boudary errors.
